    "Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. Thus, it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5."

This complete data of heights perfectly falls on the normal distribution and follows all its laws. The normal distribution is maintained not only in Economic aspects but also in Biological aspects, Electrical Circuit, Physics, and many more. Normal Distribution is also easy to generate random numbers from and, because of its shape, useful in things like density estimations."
